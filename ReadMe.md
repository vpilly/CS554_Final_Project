## Setup Instructions

The backend server uses to docker-compose in order to start up both the docker and rabbitMQ services.
If you would like to use it, install docker compose and run docker-compose up.

Additionally, both the frontend and backend require a specific env file. I have included a sample env and a template env for the two applications.

Both the front-end and back-end run with npm start.

If the backend does not run, try npm run build
